## Is your feature request related to a problem?

Modules containing overrides are quite delicate, currently the only way to know if a module contains overrides or if it has been overridden, is to go to FTP.

## Describe the solution you'd like

It would be interesting to have information on modules which contain overrides or which have been overridden.

### Shop Back-office

- During installation/uninstallation display a warning popup and ask for confirmation if the module contains overrides.
- Have the list of modules containing overrides or that have been overridden (See **POC** section)

- We can measure the complexity of a site in terms of custom developments. (Agency bench-marking for exemple)
